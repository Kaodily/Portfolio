          My name is Chika, and Iâ€™m a Web Designer with a Strong Sense of Humor
          and Creative Expertise!

          I'm a passionate web designer with years of experience in creating
          clean, user-friendly designs. "I'm a software developer who likes to
          debug code and solve problems. In fact, my brain is like a
          never-ending loopâ€”I can't help but think in if-else statements even
          when I'm grocery shopping. So if you see me staring at the cereal
          aisle, don't worry, I'm just trying to optimize my breakfast routine!"
